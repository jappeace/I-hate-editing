#+TITLE: I hate video editing
Therefore I present a small script that glues your video together
based on unix order file names:

+ 1-opening.wav
+ 1-openingimg.png
+ 2-intromusic.wav
+ 3-wittycomments.wav
+ 2..3-introandcommentimg.png

This will make a video starting with the opening.wav where the openingimg 
will be displayed untill the wav ends.
It'll make the image sequences as long as their respective audio fragments.
This is ideal for slideshow like videos.
You can also have images span multiple audio fragments as seen in the 2..3
example.

It is already functional but you have to modifiy the path right now manually
to the source directory you want to use.

* TODO
Probably add some kind of button to blender to select the directory and 
execute the script. I wanted to make it command line only at first but 
I'm not sure if you can pass parameters to blender.
